# peri-auto
#### An automator for youtube-dl, mostly a learning exercise

## This shouldn't be used by anyone, I'm just smashing rocks together and it could be really dangerous! Please beware!

The prefs.txt file has the target Periscope user's URL in the first line, and below that you put URLs of broadcasts that you don't want to download (i.e. ones you've already seen). Youtube-dl then batch converts to 64k .m4a files.

## This was made by a beginner, please be very careful!
